    <p>I went to the University of Missouri and graduated in 2011 with a bachelors of science degree in fisheries and wildlife.
       While I was there I played on the wheelchair basketball team. I graduated from Jefferson College with an associate of applied science
       degree in veterinary technology in 2014.
